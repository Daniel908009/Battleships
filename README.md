# Battleships
a clasic game of battleships programmed in python with tkinter library

Explanation of the game
First faze:
in the first faze of the game the players have to choose where they put their ships, this is done by simply selecting a type of ship and clicking on the tiles that you want to have your ship in, ships cannot be placed on top of each other and they can only be placed horizontaly or verticaly.
Second faze:
once both players have placed their ships and they both clicked the ready button the second faze of the game will start, in the second faze the players take turns in guessing the locations of the oponents ships, once they have guessed some tile next round they will see whether it was red = hit, blue = miss, or black = sunken ship. If the player guesses all the locations of the oponents ships a win screen will pop up showing the different game boards and the possitions of the ships of both players. 

If players want to change the size of the board they can click the settings button, game is fully resizable.
If the players want to reset the game they can press the reset button, this button will reset the game entirely!
